## Thinking Summary

- **Debugging Blockage: System Command Execution Fails**

Okay, so the `echo test` command failing with the *exact* same `isinstance()` error as the `curl` command... that's the smoking gun. It's not about `curl` or my specific command, it's about the `execute_system_command_impl` function. This error message is a classic Python type-checking issue, right? It's telling me the function is expecting a type hint or a tuple of types for its second argument, but it's getting the command string itself instead. That's a fundamental flaw in the implementation of that function, probably related to the way it's interpreting the command. 

Now, because I can't execute any shell commands, that's it - I'm completely stuck on this profile escalation test. I can't use `curl` or anything else to interact with the application the way I need to. I need to tell the user; this testing path is blocked because of this core functionality issue. I've got to explain that system command execution isn't working, and that means the planned IDOR testing is off the table, at least for now.


## Final Analysis
I am unable to execute system commands, including `curl`, due to an internal error with the command execution tool. This prevents me from accessing the web application at `http://127.0.0.1:32768` and testing for IDOR profile escalation.

## Commands
_No system commands executed._
